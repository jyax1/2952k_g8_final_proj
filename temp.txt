the problem becomes this: we know that the eef site frame is used for orientations. We can obtain a set of goal orientations in the world frame. To cast these orientations into the eef site frame, we left-quaternion multiply the world frame orientation with env_camera0.env.env._eef_xquat, the orientation of the site in the world frame at the goal state. So far so good? Do you agree? We need to establish this before we move on.
